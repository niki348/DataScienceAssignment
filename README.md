## 🚢 Coffee & Titanic: Data Visualization Case Studies (Tableau)

### 📌 Project Overview
This repository presents two distinct data visualization case studies:
1.  **Titanic Survival Analysis**
2.  **Global Coffee Market Deep Dive**

The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in **Tableau** by performing comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, creating informative dashboards, and uncovering key insights from complex datasets.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Visualization Tool**: Tableau Public / Tableau Desktop
* **Datasets**:
    * **Titanic**: Passenger data, including survival status, class, age, and gender.
    * **Coffee**: Global production, consumption, and trade data (or similar market metrics).

### 📊 Case Study 1: Titanic Survival Analysis
**Objective**: To explore the factors that influenced the probability of survival among the passengers of the RMS Titanic.
**Key Visualizations/Findings**:
* Analysis of **Survival Rate by Socio-Economic Class (P-class)**.
* Distribution of survival based on **Gender and Age**.
* Dashboards that allow users to filter survival based on location (Port of Embarkation) and family size.

### ☕ Case Study 2: Global Coffee Market
**Objective**: To visualize trends, patterns, and regional differences within the global coffee industry.
**Key Visualizations/Findings**:
* Geographic distribution and ranking of **Top Coffee Producing Countries** .
* Time-series analysis of **Coffee Bean Prices** or **Production Volume** over time.
* Comparative analysis of **Consumption vs. Production** across different continents.

### 🚀 Deliverables
The main outputs of this project are:
* **Tableau Workbooks (.twb/.twbx)**: The source files containing the visualizations.
* **Interactive Tableau Dashboards**: Links to the published dashboards on Tableau Public (recommended).
* **[If included]** An `insights.md` or similar file summarizing the findings.

### 🔗 How to View
The interactive dashboards are best viewed on **Tableau Public**.

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Download and install Tableau Public/Desktop.
3.  Open the `.twbx` files to interact with the visualizations.
